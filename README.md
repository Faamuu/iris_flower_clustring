## Iris Flower Clustering Project

Welcome to the "iris_flower_clustring" project repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to perform clustering on the famous Iris flower dataset. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/Faamuu/iris_flower_clustring.git).

### Project Overview

This project is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries, creating a clustering model to analyze the Iris flower dataset. The primary goal is to group similar iris flowers based on their features, contributing to a better understanding of the dataset.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The project employs clustering algorithms such as K-means to group iris flowers.
  
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The analysis and implementation are documented in Jupyter Notebooks, providing an interactive and comprehensive view of the process.

- **Data Exploration:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are utilized to gain insights into the dataset, ensuring a robust foundation for clustering.

### Getting Started
